      <h2>Understanding Intestacy in Queensland</h2>
      <p>When a person passes away without leaving a valid will, they are considered to have died "intestate." In Queensland, this situation means that the distribution of their estate is determined by intestacy laws rather than personal wishes. The court follows a set formula to identify heirs and beneficiaries, which may not align with the deceased’s personal intentions.</p>
      <p>Intestacy laws prioritize family members in a specific order, usually starting with a spouse or children. If neither exists, the estate may pass to other relatives such as parents, siblings, or even distant kin. This process can become complex, especially if multiple parties believe they have a legitimate claim.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Who Inherits When There’s No Will?</h2>
      <p>The order of inheritance in Queensland begins with the surviving spouse, who typically receives the majority share of the estate. If children are also involved, the distribution is divided between the spouse and the children based on statutory rules. These laws aim to maintain fairness, but they often lead to disputes when beneficiaries disagree.</p>
      <p>Without a will, blended families or non-traditional relationships may face significant complications. For example, stepchildren are generally not considered legal heirs under intestacy unless they have been formally adopted. This is one of the many reasons why probate without a will often requires professional assistance.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>The Role of Probate in Intestate Estates</h2>
      <p>Even without a will, the estate still requires administration through probate. The court appoints an administrator—usually a close family member—to manage assets, settle debts, and ensure lawful distribution. This appointment acts similarly to the role of an executor when a valid will exists.</p>
      <p>The administrator has a duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. However, managing an intestate estate often involves added challenges, as disputes are more likely to arise in the absence of clear instructions from the deceased. This is where legal guidance becomes invaluable.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Why Professional Guidance is Crucial</h2>
      <p>Handling probate without a will can be overwhelming for families already dealing with grief. Legal processes, strict timelines, and documentation requirements make the role of an administrator especially stressful. Many families seek support from <a href="https://qldestatelawyers.com.au/probate-lawyers/" target="_blank">Probate Solicitors QLD</a> to ensure compliance and reduce conflicts.</p>
      <p>Probate solicitors help interpret intestacy laws, manage paperwork, and represent families in court proceedings if necessary. By engaging professionals early, families can avoid costly mistakes and delays in distributing the estate.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Potential Complications Without a Will</h2>
      <p>Disputes are one of the most common issues in intestate estates. Siblings may disagree on asset division, estranged spouses may assert claims, and unexpected heirs may surface. These disputes often escalate into legal battles, delaying closure and increasing costs for all parties involved.</p>
      <p>Another complication arises when the estate includes complex assets such as businesses, trusts, or overseas property. Without clear instructions, administrators may struggle to determine fair distribution, increasing the need for court oversight and legal advice.</p>
